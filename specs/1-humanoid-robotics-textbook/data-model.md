# Data Model for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This document describes the content structure and entities for the textbook, primarily managed by Docusaurus.

## Entities

### Module
Represents a major section of the textbook, grouping related chapters. Corresponds to a Docusaurus category.

-   **`id`**: Unique identifier for the module (e.g., `module-1-ros2`). Used internally by Docusaurus.
-   **`label`**: Display name of the module (e.g., "Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)"). Appears in the sidebar.
-   **`link`**: Link to the index page of the module, often automatically generated by Docusaurus from a `_category_.json` file.
-   **`items`**: An ordered list of chapters belonging to this module.

### Chapter
Represents a single learning unit within a module. Corresponds to a Docusaurus MDX file (`.mdx`).

-   **`id`**: Unique identifier for the chapter (e.g., `chapter-1.1-intro-ros2`). Used internally and in URLs.
-   **`title`**: Chapter title, displayed at the top of the page and in the sidebar.
-   **`description`**: A brief summary of the chapter's content. Used for SEO and metadata.
-   **`sidebar_position`**: A numeric value determining the order of the chapter within its module in the sidebar.
-   **`file_path`**: The relative path to the MDX file within the `docs/` directory (e.g., `docs/01-module/01-chapter.mdx`).

### Exercise
Practical tasks or problem-solving activities for students, embedded within chapters.

-   **`Problem Statement`**: Clear description of the task.
-   **`Input`**: Any required setup or initial conditions.
-   **`Expected Outcome`**: What the student should achieve or observe.
-   **`Solution Guidance`**: (Optional) Hints, partial solutions, or links to full solutions.

### Code Snippet
Sections of runnable code embedded within chapters to illustrate concepts.

-   **`Language`**: Programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Bash).
-   **`Code`**: The actual code block.
-   **`Description`**: Explanation of what the code does.
-   **`Output`**: (Optional) Expected output from running the code.

### Diagram
Visual representations of concepts, systems, or processes.

-   **`Type`**: Type of diagram (e.g., Mermaid flowchart, sequence diagram, SVG, PNG).
-   **`Source`**: Mermaid syntax directly in MDX or file path to an image (`static/img/`).
-   **`Caption`**: Descriptive title for the diagram.

### Reference/Citation
Academic papers, official documentation, or other sources supporting technical claims.

-   **`Type`**: (e.g., "Peer-reviewed paper", "Official documentation", "Book").
-   **`Author/Organization`**: Creator of the source.
-   **`Title`**: Title of the work.
-   **`Year`**: Publication year.
-   **`URL/DOI`**: Link to the source.
-   **`Citation Key`**: Short identifier for in-text citations.

## Relationships

-   A **Textbook** consists of multiple **Modules**.
-   A **Module** contains multiple **Chapters**.
-   A **Chapter** can contain multiple **Exercises**, **Code Snippets**, and **Diagrams**.
-   **References/Citations** are linked from **Chapters** (supporting technical claims).
