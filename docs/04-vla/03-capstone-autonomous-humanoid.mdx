# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

This capstone chapter integrates all concepts learned throughout the textbook to guide you through building a fully autonomous, voice-controlled humanoid robot in a simulated environment. You will apply knowledge of ROS 2, simulation, AI algorithms, and VLA integration.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<!-- Content about the overall project goal and scope will go here.
     Emphasize the integration of LLM, voice control, planning, and manipulation.
-->
<!-- Placeholder: Tag key terms for glossary inclusion in this section. -->

<h2>System Architecture</h2>

<!-- Content detailing the architecture of the autonomous humanoid robot will go here.
     This should clearly show the integration points for:
     - LLM for high-level command interpretation.
     - Voice-to-action mapping module.
     - Planning & navigation systems.
     - Object manipulation capabilities.
     - ROS 2 communication.
-->

<h2>Implementation Steps</h2>

<!-- Content outlining step-by-step implementation will go here.
     This should cover:
     - Setting up LLM integration.
     - Developing voice command processing and action mapping.
     - Implementing planning and navigation algorithms.
     - Integrating object manipulation.
     - Code snippets for key components.

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<!-- Exercises related to the Capstone Project will go here.
     These exercises should cover:
     - Implementing a sub-component of the autonomous humanoid robot (e.g., a specific voice command, a planning module).
     - Integrating multiple components and testing their interaction.
     - Debugging an end-to-end autonomous task.
