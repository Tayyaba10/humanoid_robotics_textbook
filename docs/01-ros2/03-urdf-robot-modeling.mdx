# Bringing Robots to Life with URDF and `ros2_control`

## Module Objective

To introduce the core concepts and practical applications of ROS 2 as the foundational software framework for humanoid robotics, enabling students to set up, understand, and interact with a robot's "nervous system."

## Learning Goals

Upon completing this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Understand the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) for robot modeling.
*   Create a simple URDF model for a humanoid limb.
*   Introduce `ros2_control` for hardware abstraction and simple joint control.
*   Visualize URDF models in `RViz2`.

## Core Topics

This chapter will cover:

### 1. Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)

*   Introduction to URDF: What it is and why it's used.
*   XML structure of URDF: `<robot>`, `<link>`, `<joint>`.
*   Defining kinematic chains: parent and child links, joint types.
*   Adding visual and collision properties.
*   Using `xacro` for modular and parametric URDF models.

### 2. Robot State Publishing and Visualization

*   `robot_state_publisher`: Publishing joint states to TF.
*   `joint_state_publisher`: Reading joint values and publishing them.
*   Introduction to `RViz2`: A powerful 3D visualization tool for ROS 2.
*   Displaying URDF models in `RViz2`.

### 3. Introduction to `ros2_control`

*   Overview of `ros2_control` architecture: Hardware interfaces, controllers.
*   Why `ros2_control`? Hardware abstraction and standardization.
*   Setting up a simple `ros2_control` configuration for a basic robot.
*   Basic concepts of position and velocity controllers.

## Hands-on Exercise: 2-DOF Robotic Arm with URDF and `ros2_control`

Model a 2-Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using URDF. Configure `robot_state_publisher` and `joint_state_publisher` to visualize this arm in `RViz2`. Extend the model to integrate with `ros2_control` to implement a basic position controller for one of the arm's joints, allowing you to command its movement through ROS 2.

## Constraints

*   This chapter focuses on kinematic models and basic position control.
*   We will not cover complex dynamics, advanced force control, or real-world hardware integration in this chapter.
