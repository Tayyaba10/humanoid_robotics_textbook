# ROS 2: The Brain's Operating System

## Module Objective

To introduce the core concepts and practical applications of ROS 2 as the foundational software framework for humanoid robotics, enabling students to set up, understand, and interact with a robot's "nervous system."

## Learning Goals

Upon completing this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Understand the core architecture of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, actions).
*   Set up a ROS 2 Jazzy development environment on an RTX workstation.
*   Learn to use basic ROS 2 command-line tools.
*   Create and run simple ROS 2 nodes in Python.

## Core Topics

This chapter will cover:

### 1. Introduction to ROS 2

*   What is ROS 2?
*   Why ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics?
*   Key architectural concepts: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions.
*   The Data Distribution Service (DDS) layer.

### 2. Setting Up Your ROS 2 Development Environment

*   System requirements (RTX Workstation recommended).
*   Detailed installation guide for ROS 2 Jazzy.
*   Verifying your installation.
*   Introduction to `colcon` build system.

### 3. Basic ROS 2 Command-Line Tools

*   `ros2 run`: Executing ROS 2 nodes.
*   `ros2 topic`: Inspecting and publishing to topics.
*   `ros2 node`: Managing and inspecting nodes.
*   Other essential commands for debugging and introspection.

### 4. Your First ROS 2 Program in Python

*   Overview of `rclpy` (ROS 2 Client Library for Python).
*   Creating a simple "talker" node.
*   Creating a simple "listener" node.
*   Understanding message types and publishing/subscribing.

## Hands-on Exercise: "Hello ROS 2 World"

Create two Python nodes: a "talker" that publishes a string message "Hello ROS 2 from Talker!" to a `/chatter` topic every second, and a "listener" that subscribes to `/chatter` and prints the received messages. You will compile, run, and observe the communication between these nodes using ROS 2 command-line tools.

## Constraints

*   This chapter focuses on a single-machine setup.
*   We will not delve into distributed systems or advanced network configurations for ROS 2 at this stage.
