## Prompt

/sp.implement Write Module 4 – Chapter 2 in MDX

## Response snapshot

Created `humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/04-vla/02-cognitive-planning-action-sequencing.mdx` with initial content for Cognitive Planning and Action Sequencing.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The initial MDX file for Module 4, Chapter 2 has been created, covering Cognitive Planning & Action Sequencing.

- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with the next tasks for Module 4 or other modules as per the `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process followed the established pattern. The content for Cognitive Planning & Action Sequencing was generated, including the required frontmatter and conceptual information. Glossary term tags and references were included.
