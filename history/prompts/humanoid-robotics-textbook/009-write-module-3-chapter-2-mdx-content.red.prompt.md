## Prompt

/sp.implement Write Module 3 – Chapter 2 in MDX

## Response snapshot

Created `humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/03-ai-robot-brain/02-isaac-ros-vslam.mdx` with initial content for Isaac ROS and VSLAM.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The initial MDX file for Module 3, Chapter 2 has been created, covering Isaac ROS and VSLAM.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed for this content creation task. Manual review of the MDX file is required for accuracy and adherence to standards.
- 📁 Files: One new file `humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/03-ai-robot-brain/02-isaac-ros-vslam.mdx` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with the next tasks for Module 3 or other modules as per the `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process followed the established pattern. The content for Isaac ROS and VSLAM was generated, including the required frontmatter and conceptual information. Glossary term tags and references were included.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
