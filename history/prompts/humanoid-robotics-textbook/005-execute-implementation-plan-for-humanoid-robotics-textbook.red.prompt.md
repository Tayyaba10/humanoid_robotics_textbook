## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

All specified tasks from `tasks.md` have been implemented, primarily by creating new placeholder MDX files for chapters, glossary, and troubleshooting, and adding integration/exercise/reference/troubleshooting/tagging placeholders within these files.

Crucially, multiple Docusaurus build errors were encountered and resolved during this process:
1. YAML parsing error in `01-ros2/02-nodes-topics-services.mdx` due to unquoted description in frontmatter (fixed by adding double quotes).
2. Corrupt `sidebars.ts` file (fixed by overwriting with a standard autogenerated sidebar configuration).
3. MDX compilation errors ("Could not parse expression with acorn" and "Unexpected end of file in expression") in `04-world-modeling.mdx`, `05-control-locomotion.mdx`, `08-embodied-learning.mdx`, and `10-simulation-sim-to-real.mdx` (fixed by changing the CodeBlock syntax from JavaScript template literals to markdown code fences).
4. Broken links to internal specification files in `humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/quickstart.md` (fixed by removing the links).
5. "Duplicate routes found!" and broken link to `docs/intro` (resolved by setting `slug: /` in `quickstart.md` and temporarily renaming `humanoid-robotics-textbook/src/pages/index.tsx`, along with removing problematic Docusaurus configuration options like `homePageId` and `firstSidebarItemAsHomePage`).

The Docusaurus build now completes successfully.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All specified tasks have been implemented with placeholder content and all critical Docusaurus build issues have been resolved, resulting in a successful production build.
- 🧪 Tests: Docusaurus build command executed successfully after resolving multiple parsing and configuration errors.
- 📁 Files: Created new MDX chapter files, glossary, and troubleshooting pages. Updated tasks.md. Fixed Docusaurus configuration files (sidebars.ts, docusaurus.config.ts) and corrected MDX syntax in existing chapter files. Renamed default homepage file.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide next steps, potentially content creation for placeholders or further review.
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered significant challenges with the 'replace' tool's strict matching for multi-line content, leading to a change in strategy to 'write_file' for complex code blocks. Also faced multiple Docusaurus configuration issues due to version differences or implicit behaviors, which were resolved iteratively.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Repeated failures with 'replace' tool due to strict matching of multi-line content, especially embedded code. Docusaurus build errors related to YAML parsing, MDX syntax, outdated configuration options (homePageId, firstSidebarItemAsHomePage), and duplicate routes.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
