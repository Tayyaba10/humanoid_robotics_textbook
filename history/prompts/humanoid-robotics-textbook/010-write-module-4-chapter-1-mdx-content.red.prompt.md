## Prompt

/sp.implement Write Module 4 – Chapter 1 in MDX

## Response snapshot

Created `humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/04-vla/01-voice-command-integration.mdx` with initial content for Voice Command Integration using OpenAI Whisper.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The initial MDX file for Module 4, Chapter 1 has been created, covering Voice Command Integration using OpenAI Whisper.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed for this content creation task. Manual review of the MDX file is required for accuracy and adherence to standards.

- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with the next tasks for Module 4 or other modules as per the `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process followed the established pattern. The content for Voice Command Integration (OpenAI Whisper) was generated, including the required frontmatter and conceptual information. Glossary term tags and references were included.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
