## Prompt

/sp.implement Write Module 2 – Chapter 1 in MDX

## Response snapshot

Created `humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/02-simulation/01-gazebo-basics.mdx` with initial content for Gazebo Simulation Basics.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The initial MDX file for Module 2, Chapter 1 has been created, covering Gazebo Simulation Basics.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed for this content creation task. Manual review of the MDX file is required for accuracy and adherence to standards.
- 📁 Files: One new file `humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/02-simulation/01-gazebo-basics.mdx` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with the next tasks for Module 2 or other modules as per the `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process followed the established pattern. The content for Gazebo Simulation Basics was generated, including the required frontmatter and conceptual information. Glossary term tags and references were included.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell script execution policy still prevented automated prerequisite checks.
